# Design
This site is very design oriented. ALthough i have added Javsscript features a little.
We can download the code from github, onto a IDE like vsCode, and run it with live server.
I ahve tried making it responsive, but not as much as I could have. 

We can try responsiveness of the site, but making the viewport smaller in size, and see the site adjusting to the screen size.

I have tried the INtersection Observer API for the first time within 4 hours, and successfully made a small feature of JS in the site.
Also have used Advanced CSS concepts,without any library, JUst PURE CSS magic.
